# In the Bowels of the Mind

In the bowels of the mind is an atmospheric horror game experienced through the mechanics of a simple walking simulator. The player takes on the role of an unknown protagonist who is trapped in his mind. "Trapped in the recursion of its memories, you feel the walls shifting, morphing, changing shape; its impermanence everlasting. Time flies, yet no one can tell. You, only, feel its momentary swings. You begin your escape, navigating through its seemingly endless bowels. You take the first step. The mind is aware." The environment itself is a manifestation of the protagonistâ€™s recurring memories in his subconscious. The narrative itself is centered around him being trapped and having to escape through the ever changing halls. As he navigates through the hallways which loop in the shape of a square, the objects and lights in his surrounding either change location, appear or disappear.
