# Lumograph

**[lumograph](http://www.miha-co.ca/lumograph)** is a film photography archiving web app that provides a quick and easy alternative to bulk process a substantial amount of photos and archive them according to the characteristics of their roll in a chronological manner. It also allows the users to create 'collections' of photos that look good together for the purposes of showcasing them online as part of their portfolio piece.

# Master archive

It is important to note that the app's purpose is not solely limited to the collections feature. At its core, I intended this to be an archiving app that would index all of photos in 1 simple operation. Therefore, I include the 'master archive' section where the user can see a ledger of all the photos he took, regardless of whether or not it is displayed in the collections. **[You can access the ledger here](http://www.miha-co.ca/lumograph/master)**.

# API development

While lumograph in its current state is limited to one user (me), I would like to invest more time into making it more usable for other people. A big part of my design philosophy when making this was to have the data readily accessible by user's. This is why I decided to make an API for lumograph (**[you can access it here](http://www.miha-co.ca/lumograph/api)**). Currently, the API only accommodates the collections. But, I plan to accommodate the master archive as well for a broader range.
