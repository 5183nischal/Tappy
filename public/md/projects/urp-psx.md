# Summary

Playstation 1 era retro graphics plugin optimized for Unity's Universal Rendering Pipeline with Shadergraph. The aim of this plugin was to use Unity's new pipeline to create NPR (non-photorealistic) PSX-style retro graphics with the shadergraph as the basis for materials and URP's render features as the basis for post processing effects.

# Features

The plugin comes fully-featured with a single lit/unlit graph where you can enable/disable features according to your needs (and even modify them). I segmented every feature into a subgraph to hopefully make it easier to just plug n' play.
