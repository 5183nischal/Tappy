Welcome to my personal development log. It's pretty much a place where I archive my feelings, RAW & UNEDITED, while I code...

Big update! A lot has happened since my last log. Hence, the tardiness of this entry. Short and concise! A couple of thing:
- Got my first freelance client as a interactive developer
- Got some exciting ideas for what types of projects I should be focusing on next!
- Started reading a lot more often before I go to bed and while I am going to work. Picked up this book called [Mastery by Robert Greene](https://www.amazon.ca/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X). Would highly recommend if you like doing a lot of things but feeling lost as to what you should commit your time to

# log.0022 - Becoming a multidisciplinary creative coder
## 17.06.2019

I started a recent project to design a main title design sequence in Cinema4D and Octane. I think I've been neglecting studying design for quite some time. I started picking up new books on layouts, grids, and typography. I am going to treat this as a graphic design project for now in the hopes of gathering better knowledge in how to present work.

### ~

This project, called "Serva" for now, kind of came out of a need to refine the presentation element of my previous projects. I consider myself to be better at coding than I am at creating visuals. But, I am sure that a lot of creative developers would agree that it's hard to make your body work relatable if you don't put some emphasis on how your work relates to things you see in real life. For instance, I could develop some cool algorithms that renders out hundreds of weird cool looking cubes on a screen. However, it's hard for an average person to see the context of that algorithm if presented by itself. The same can be said about concept art. An artist could develop 10-20 frames of an environment. But, by themselves, they don't stand for much except for the ideas they present (and their illustration skills).

I'll admit... I started crawling behance a lot more over the last 2 weeks. Aside from the amount of inspiration it gave me, it made me understand the importance of not only presenting work in a nice manner **but presenting work in a real-world context**. I'll explain what I mean by that. It's one thing to present a couple of frames of a 3D environment. It's another to present those frames as a moving titles sequence or a set of movie posters. Likewise, the same thing can be said about logos portrayed as a simple png image versus on a mockup of a person holding a business card. What I am trying to say is that context goes a long way when you are trying to maximize your reach with these projects. I find that the better projects on behance (and in general) do exactly that. They guide you through the process and, by the end, they leave you with a solid idea of where it belongs.

### ~

> **"Great Codrin! This is all nice for graphic designers and concept artists. But, it's different for programmers! You can't just create mockups out of everything you code"**

### ~

**I disagree!** I think creative coders ought to try to create those mockups. Often times, you see those same developers posting progress shots of their latest shader, generative algorithm or procedural generator. You can see that they put a lot of time and effort into creating these things and I credit them for their grit and persistence. However, just try to imagine if they put 1/5th of the time they used to create said program into creating context for those said programs. I think you can agree that we would see a lot more programmers/creative coders on sites like behance and dribble.

Now it might seem like I am going on a rant. However, the point I making here is much bigger than programmers needing to create mockups. For instance, you may notice that a lot of people like to call themselves "Multidisciplinary" (myself included). But, I've only recently understood what that word meant. You might think that the word is synonymous with a person who knows how to use multiple tools/software while simultaneously diving into multiple disciplines all at once. But, I'll argue that it's only half of the definition. I believe that being multidisciplinary has to do more with your ability to create at the cross-section between disciplines. In other words, someone who combines knowledge from distinct disciplines to create something new and exciting. I think you are starting to see where I am going with this.

### ~

Being a creative coder can sometimes feel like a Daniel Shiffman tutorial. You write some code in processing or openframeworks and then you end up with some nice visuals that looks like some of [Casey Reas's work](http://reas.com/). And granted, you now have interesting patterns to look at.

**However... IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END THERE!**. Part of being a good designer (not that I am the best of ones) is tied to your ability to make sense of the work you produce in a real world setting. So, the next time you try to code something in processing(or whatever framework you like to use). I would highly encourage you to think how your output could manifest itself in other mediums.

You made a bunch of procedurally generated cool-looking cubes? GREAT! How about you make a poster with those visuals or some motion graphics!
You made some triangles that react to experimental music? GREAT! How about you incorporate them in a VJ toolkit for live performances!
You discovered some interesting patterns in your generative algorithm? GREAT! Make an infographic with it to drive a narrative!

The list goes on and on...

I believe this to be a great creative exercise for people who strive to be more multidisciplinary. You stand to gain so much from it on top of that.

1. You won't be limited to what you currently know.
2. You become more attractive to companies/clients by making them understand how your work can fit into other people's work. **You become resourceful!**
3. The work you produce will truly be one of a kind.

So, the next time you dabble in creative code. Think of how you can extend your work beyond your medium and into the real-world.

It's currently 8:52am as I am writing this in a coffee shop. Sipping on some green tea...espressos don't cut it anymore (they make me anxious). My work pace has been slow over the last few days. I am beginning to settle into the fact that I'll be working non-stop at my new job in Tokyo, starting September. The priority right now is to get mentally prepped for the workload that and settle the visa paperwork as soon as I am able to.

The rest should be easy.

It's been 4 days since the last log. Here are some things that happened!
>
- I decided to use my free time during the summer as a creative sabbatical to create as many high quality projects as I can before I start my new job
- I started 3 new projects, one of them having to do with asteroids (reason why I inserted that picture).
- I reduced the number of 0's in my logs entries (it was too excessive).
- Started re-learning c4d from scratch to get solid fundamentals.

I guess that's pretty much it for the update. I think I want to make a short film...

After some good strides of productivity, I managed to finish the 1.0 version of lumograph. To give a quick rundown, lumograph is a film photography archiving web app that provides a quick and easy alternative to bulk process a substantial amount of photos and archive them according to the characteristics of their roll in a chronological manner. It also allows the users to create 'collections' of photos that look good together for the purposes of showcasing them online as part of their portfolio piece.

### ~

The creation of this app took about 3 weeks (give or take) with so minor adjustments still needed in terms of polishing... to be continued

## 17.05.2019
Back at it again, this time in the afternoon. Yesterday was a big success in terms of productivity and progress. After spending a solid 9 hours on the task, I managed to finish the back end for lumograph. The app now detects the photo collections through the folder and cross references the photos with the master database to assign the photo settings.

### ~

To put things into perspective, I have about ~1200 film photos that needed archiving. With lumograph, each photo will be indexed with a number from 0 to 1200. The lower the number, the earlier this photo was taken. Photos are also assigned their roll type (e.g. Fuji, Ektar, Rollei etc...) and the roll number so people know If that photo was part of the 2nd roll or the 32nd roll. And finally, the photos have their respective ISO settings assigned to them as well. This is all thanks to the batch processing script that I made.

## 16.05.2019
The recursive algorithm now works. I have a data structure that will index each picture with a unique ID, the file name, the film type, the roll number and the ISO setting. This will serve as a sort of "master ledger" that my app can use to reference the settings of the picture when it is re-arranged into collections.

## 14.05.2019
Woke up a bit later today, I looked back at yesterday and realized that I had fixed most of my problems with file walker. After some research, it turned out that a recursive algorithm is what I needed.

> Today's tasks:
- Finish the file walker algorithm
- Polish the css on my site (miha-ko) for more responsiveness
- Start thinking about the UI/UX design for lumograph (my photo archiving app)

I'll be eating curry tonight.

**Big update** since my last log. As you can see, we skipped 2 months. I think it's because I had no incentive to keep logging all this stuff. BUT NOW I DO!!! I finished dev_log and it is ready to be deployed with my node.js applications. I read a book called ["Type Matters"](https://www.amazon.ca/Type-Matters-Jim-Williams/dp/1858945674) and this app (log) pretty much showcases what I learnt from it. It came at the recommendation of [Valerie](https://www.valeriebourdon.com/). It's a great read for those looking to grasp the fundamentals of typography(which is what I needed).

I failed to merge all my branches yesterday because I had fun and got drunk. Good times! Gonna attempt yesterday's task again today. I've also been researching IR/Red filters because I bought a Rollei Infrared roll this week (Yes, I love film photography/ Shoutout to Tuomas for introducing me to this beautiful hobby).

I came across a new way to write down notes so I don't need to commit my markdown file everytime. I'm smelling sugar cookies right now. Gonna probably eat some and drink tea with it before merging all my branches on obsidian.

So I've been busy over the last days doing either nothing or coding for some projects. Emotionally speaking, life is great at the moment. I think I really lucked out on what happened to me a couple of weeks ago. But now is also a time to stay focused as things are catching up to me (work-wise).

The gym is really helping me with stress and all that. It's kind of silly that we don't really emphasize the role of exercise when it comes to focus. It's excellent! Who knew 20 minutes of exercise/3 times a week could improve my lifestyle so much. I feel stupid for not committing to this earlier in life.

Alright, it's really pissing me off! I haven't been able to figure out how to properly manipulate the point clouds on the kinect and my teammates are depending on me.

I really need to resume my projects for this semester. Next week is reading week so I can catch up with the kinect project in the black box. Working with the scripts that Jason Walters made. Pretty dope stuff!

Sorry, been a long time since my log. Had a lot of interesting things happen this week. I'm still wondering if I should included it in this log though. It's already like a diary of some weird programmer dude. I wear glasses btw.

So I am happy again because I now understand shaders (at least how they work inside the system).
Can't say too much about coding them. I took on a number of projects where I said I was going to do the shader work.
I'll know in 6 weeks if this was a wise decision.
It's one of those "learning comes with a risk" kind of moment...

I cleaned up some of the junk. I realized that I really bad at naming conventions and keeping things organized as I go. I really need to focus on 1 thing at a time.

On side note, I think I am going to use this dev log for pretty much everything and not just my website.
Ok now I am writing something completely unrelated to my website. I hope you came prepared.

Here we go ...
I started researching shaderlab shaders in unity
I want to get a result similar to what Maciej Kuciara had done in Vray but in unity
- [Shader #1](https://twitter.com/maciejkuciara/status/999355022096846848)
- [Shader #2](https://twitter.com/maciejkuciara/status/999268140377878531)
- [Shader #3](https://twitter.com/maciejkuciara/status/999177535404593152)

Yes, I know!! I break my own rules like that. Such a baddass .....

I have a good lead on how to do specific page IDs with Node now. Also I added dates to my logs now so people know that I am from the 21st century.

Turns out ejs is not bad and I was being stupid. Now it works fine and I can understand why its good. Im happy.

> "data.forEach(function(o)
o.project"


also need to stringify the data before putting it in the template...
I always seem to forget when I put stuff in arrays for some reason.

# log.0003

Well those 問題s won't fix themselves. I thought ejs(Embedded Javascript Templates) was the perfect crush but I was wrong.

#### *

# log.0002

Platform now has ejs included. Syntax is not whitespace-based which makes me happy. I tried Jade and Mustache but they were not good fits. I attached a JSON database to it. But I'll see if ill keep it.

Still thinking about sub-domains...

#### *

# log.0001

The platform needs to include several segments and should be built horizontally. My current idea is to have mihako built on 3 pillars, the interaction pillar, the visual/experimental pillar and the photography/archive pillar.

More thoughts on making odessa its own pillar as well...
