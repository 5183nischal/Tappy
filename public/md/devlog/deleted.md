>"Idle hands are the devil's workshop!"

That quote is something I pulled from the movie "Alien: Covenant". You hear it from David, Weyland's personal android, when he's showing the captain of the his workshop of dissected aliens.

This quote pretty much summarizes how I feel today which is idle. I mean... **REALLY IDLE**. Kind of hard to explain which is why I am writing this in the first place. It used to be that I would enjoy playing games all day. But, for some unknown reason, I can't seem to enjoy that anymore. I think my lack of doing anything or having a daily routine is really getting to me and affecting other aspects of my daily life.

To give you a quick rundown, I just graduated university with a job lined up in Tokyo as a developer which starts in September. Until then, I've been pretty much working on my own projects, spending a lot of time with girlfriend and trying to find new leads as a freelancer (though I haven't had much success). The gist of it is that I have **a lot** of free time and this is very disorienting.

Normally, I would know how to manage it. But, recently, it's been an absolute mess. I wake up and I have nothing planned for the day. I also don't know what to do for most of the day. Generally speaking, I would just deviate to my regular coding tasks. But, it seems that I just keep bouncing between personal projects without getting much done. I think that what I miss the most is the routine I had when I was going to school or going to work, knowing full well that I was rewarded for the time I was putting in (either through new knowledge or financially).

I'm starting to realize that this is just something I am not used to. It will probably be better when I find the next cool thing I want to do or when I start my new job (I'm really looking forward to it).
